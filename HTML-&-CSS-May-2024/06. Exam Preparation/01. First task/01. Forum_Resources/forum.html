                    <p> Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will always do
                        that,
                        but
                        great
                        minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.

                <p>Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual
                    accomplishments
                    toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon
                    results.
                    Individual
                    commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a

                    work.
